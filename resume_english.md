## Introduction

I'm a physics teacher and a data scientist with a passion for technology. I currently develop projects that prioritize solving business problems, from understanding them, analyzing data, to extracting insights and implementing the solution. I also continue to develop myself with improvement and study activities such as a portfolio of data science projects and I also write about the same topic on a blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@juniorcl). 

For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in my portfolio [juniorcl.github.io](https://www.github.com/juniorcl) or from my [GitHub](https://github.com/juniorcl) page.

## Experiences

- **Data Scientist**, *Datarisk*, January 2022 - August 2024

    My work is based on exploring, cleaning and analyzing data to bring results related to business problems with the help of machine learning. Below are some example projects:

    - Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Git, SQL, Credit Score and Credit Risk.
    
    - Development of a machine learning model with the purpose of determining a better credit score through the history of individuals.

    - Development of a machine learning regression model for sales forecasting based on the history of previous years.

    - Study and application of a clustering machine learning model for understanding different customer profiles.
 
    - Implementation of a model that identifies certain customer behaviors, such as becoming premium, bad payer or having job instability.

- **Data Scientist**, *Be.X!*, March 2021 - January 2022

    As a scientist I developed projects mainly focused on insights that can come from statistical analysis or machine learning models. Below there are some examples of these projects.

    - Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Git and SQL.

    - Treatment and preparation of texts for unstructured data acquisition through regular expressions (regex).

    - Application of statistical methods to discover anomalous (outliers) points that can be harmful and fundamental for decision making.

    - Implementation and use of machine learning models that can better describe the impacts of variables on the business.

    - Machine learning model development to discover deliveries with the greatest possibility of delay through ranking metrics.
