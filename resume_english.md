## Introduction

I'm a physics professor and a data scientist with a passion for technology. I currently work as a data scientist at a company focused on logistic of fractional transport. In this company, I develop projects focused on analyzing structured and unstructured data. Such projects aim to create machine learning algorithms to generate automated insights that add value to customers. I also have a portfolio of general data science projects that can be accessed by [link](https://www.juniorcl.github.io) or from my webpage on [GitHub](https://github.com/juniorcl).

## Experiences

- **Data Scientist**, *Be.X!*, March 2021 -

    As a scientist I develop projects mainly focused on insights that can come from statistical analysis or machine learning models. Below are projects that I develop or developed.

    - Treatment and preparation of texts for unstructured data acquisition through regular expressions (regex).

    - Application of statistical methods to discover anomalous (outliers) points that can be harmful and fundamental for decision making.

    - Implementation and use of machine learning models that can better describe the impacts of variables on the business.

    - Machine learning model development to discover deliveries with the greatest possibility of delay through ranking metrics.

- **Physics Teacher**, *Pre Extrance Exam Physics Teacher*, August 2017 - August 2019

    During my master's degree I also worked as an extension fellow and professor of physics at the UENF Social Pre-Entrance Exam. During this period I mainly taught subjects related to classical mechanics. This mainly gave me public speaking experience.

## Related Activities

- **Data Scientist**, *Portfolio Projects*, November 2020 -

    As a way to study and improve myself, I carry out data science projects that can be accessed through the link [juniorcl.github.io](https://juniorcl.github.io) or through my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/juniorcl). During project preparation I use the CRISP-DM method: ranging from business understanding, data analysis, to extracting insights, to deploying the machine learning model.

- **Competitor e Contributor**, *Kaggle*, Julho 2020 -

    I work on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/juniorcl) participating in competitions and contributing through notebooks and forums. I currently have 8 bronze medals for these contributions. My most recent competition was on image recognition algorithms where I applied convolutional neural networks like [LeNet-5, getting a accuracy of 99.214%](https://www.kaggle.com/juniorcl/lenet-5-cnn-architecture-digit-recognizer).
